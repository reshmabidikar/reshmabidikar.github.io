In this blog post, I will be explaining how the Java 8 functional interface [LongSupplier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/LongSupplier.html) works. To know more about functional interfaces, you can refer [this](https://learnjava.co.in/what-is-a-functional-interface/) blog post.

\[table id=24 /\] The [LongSupplier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/LongSupplier.html) interface provides a method called [getAsLong.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/LongSupplier.html#getAsLong--) This method does not accept any arguments. It returns a Long data type. The [LongSupplier](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/LongSupplier.html) interface is a specialization of the Supplier interface that returns an Long. To see an example of the Supplier interface, refer to [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Supplier.html) blog post.

## LongSupplier example

Consider the following code snippet:

```
LongSupplier getRandom = () ->  new Random().nextLong();
System.out.println("Random number 1 = "+getRandom.getAsLong());
System.out.println("Random number 2 = "+getRandom.getAsLong());
```

Â 

Here, we have implemented the LongSupplier.getAsLong method using a lambda expression. This getAsLong method simple returns a random integer less than 100. So when this code is executed, it will print output similar to the following:

```
Random number 1 = -1689842518791524672
Random number 2 = 8225865813273814162
```

You can get the source code for this example along with other code for other Java 8 examples at the Github repository [here](https://github.com/learnjavawithreshma/Java8Demo).
