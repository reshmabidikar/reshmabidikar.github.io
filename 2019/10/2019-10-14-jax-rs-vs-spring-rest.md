In this article, I will be covering the differences between JAX-RS/Jersey and Spring REST.

## What is REST?

[REST](https://learnjava.co.in/what-is-rest-api/) stands for Representational State Transfer.  It is an architectural style that can be used for web services. A REST server exposes functionality as REST endpoints which are simply URLs. A REST client simply uses the services exposed by the REST server by accessing the corresponding URL.

## What is JAX-RS

JAX-RS stands for Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS). It is the standard Java API for developing RESTful web services. The latest version of JAX-RS is JAX-RS 2.0.  It is part of Java EE 7, so it does not need to be included separately. It is just a specification, it does not provide an implementation. Jersey is the reference implementation of JAX-RS specification. There are other implementations of JAX-RS like RESTEasy, etc

 

## What is Spring REST

The Spring framework also provides REST support. The Spring MVC module can be used to develop a REST service. It defines several annotations that you can use to develop a REST application.

## What are the differences between JAX-RS and Spring REST

Although both JAX-RS and Spring REST can be used to create a RESTful service in Java, there are several differences between the two as follows:

## Conclusion

In this article, I provided a comparison between JAX-RS and Spring REST. I hope this article was useful in understanding the differences between Spring REST and JAX-RS.
