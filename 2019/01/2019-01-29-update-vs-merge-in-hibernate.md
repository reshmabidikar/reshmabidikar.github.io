In this blog post, I will be comparing the [Update](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.0/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session.html#update-java.lang.Object-) and [Merge](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.0/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session.html#merge-java.lang.Object-) methods in Hibernate. I will be explaining how they are similar. I will also be explaining the differences between them.

Â 

#### Similarities

Both update and merge methods on the [session](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session.html) interface. Both methods update a record in the database. Both move an entity from the detached state to the persistent state.

#### Differences

The following table lists the differences between the update and merge methods:
