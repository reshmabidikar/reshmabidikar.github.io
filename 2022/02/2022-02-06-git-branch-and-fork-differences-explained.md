In this article, we will learn about the differences between git fork and branch. To learn about some Git terms you can refer to [this](https://learnjava.co.in/some-git-terminologies/) blog post.

## What is a Git branch?

A branch represents a line of development. Often, developers use different branches for production releases, bug fixes, etc. Having code in different branches enables developers to make changes to code without messing up the main line of development.

## What is a Git fork?

Forking is the process of copying someone else’s repository into your own account. So, when you fork a repository, a copy of the entire repository is available in your own account. Forking is typically used when developers want to make changes to someone else’s repository for their own purpose. Forking does not in any way affect the original repository. Developers can however submit their changes to the project owner by creating a pull request.
