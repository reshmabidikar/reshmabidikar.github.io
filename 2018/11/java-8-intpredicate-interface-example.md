In this blog post, I will be explaining how the Java 8 functional interface IntPredicateÂ works. To know more about functional interfaces, you can refer [this](https://learnjava.co.in/what-is-a-functional-interface/) blog post.

The IntPredicate interface provides a method called test. This method accepts a parameter of Integer data type and returns a boolean. The IntPredicate interface is a specialization of the Predicate interface. While the Predicate interface accepts any data type, the IntPredicate interface accepts an Integer value. To see an example of the Predicate interface, refer to [this](https://learnjava.co.in/java-8-predicate-example/) blog post.

#### IntPredicate Example

Consider the following code snippet:

````
public class IntPredicateDemo { 
    public static void main(String args[]) { 
        IntPredicate greaterThan10 = (input) -> input > 10; 
        System.out.println("4 is greater than 10 = "+greaterThan10.test(4)); 
        System.out.println("15 is greater than 10 = "+greaterThan10.test(15)); 
     } 
  }
````

Here, the `IntPredicate.test` method checks if the input number is greater than 10. So when the above code is executed, it will print the following output:

```
4 is greater than 10 = false 
15 is greater than 10 = true
```

You can get the source code for this example along with other code for other Java 8 examples at the Github repository[here](https://github.com/learnjavawithreshma/Java8Demo).
