In this article, I will be listing down a few basic instructions to create a local repository in git.

Step 1: Open a command prompt/terminal window. Navigate to the directory where you want to create a git repository.

Step 2: Initialize the directory as a local repository using the following command:

```
git init
```

Step 3: Add the files from the current directory to the local repository:

```
git add .
```

Â 

Step 4: Commit files to your local repository:

```
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

That is all!
