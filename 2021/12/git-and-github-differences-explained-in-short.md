Often, the terms Git and Github are used interchangeably. Those new to Git and Github often find this confusing. In this post, I will try to clear some confusion.

## What is Git?

In very simple terms, Git is a local version control system. Unlike other version control systems like SVN and CVS, it creates a local repository. It can be used to track changes to files.

## What is GitHub?

Github is a git repository hosting service. It can be used to share git repositories across teams. In addition to Github, there are other git repository hosting services like Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.

## More about Git and GitHub

It is important to understand that Git is a local version control system. If you are the only developer working on the code, this is fine, however, if you would like to collaborate with other developers and share your code, you will need to use a git repository hosting service like Github. Thus, Git and Github are complementary to each other.
